# FACE-DECTECTION-AND-RECOGNITION-
Entire project is been divided on two part 
1) Embedding Here we need to add the people to the database with the unique id and 5 image of the person.
2) Recognition Here it will recognise the face of the persons and show their name and id below their face.
The main concept for creating these is for enhancing the security like we will install these in to the camera of the institute then keeping an eye on the peoples becomes easy and much more secure.
